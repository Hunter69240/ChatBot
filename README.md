Uncork Wisdom - Wine Guide React App
This React application offers a visually appealing and user-friendly interface designed to provide users with wine knowledge and guidance. Key features include:

Elegant Wine-Themed Design: A full-screen background image with subtle opacity sets a sophisticated mood.

Stylish Typography: The headings use classic serif fonts with italic and small-caps styling for a refined look.

Responsive Layout: Text content is perfectly centered and spaced for readability across devices.

Chatbot Integration: Embedded Botpress chatbot scripts enable interactive wine-related conversations, enhancing user engagement.

Easy Setup: Simply clone the repo, run npm install to install dependencies, and npm start to launch the app locally.

Customizable: The background image, text styles, and chatbot scripts can be easily updated to suit different themes or chatbot instances.

Clean and Maintainable Code: Well-structured React component and CSS for effortless understanding and extension.

Modern Web Technologies: Uses React for UI and integrates external chatbot SDK via CDN for quick deployment.

To enable the chatbot, add the following scripts inside the public/index.html file just before the closing </body> tag:


<script src="https://cdn.botpress.cloud/webchat/v2.5/inject.js"></script>

<script src="https://files.bpcontent.cloud/2025/05/24/00/20250524001048-L44QRPFS.js"></script>

This project demonstrates practical skills in React development, UI design, and third-party integration, making it a great showcase for an internship portfolio.
